# MACULA SP morph tag verification

Verification of the decode-ability of SP Morph tagging as found in the [MACULA GNT](https://github.com/Clear-Bible/macula-greek/tree/main/Nestle1904/lowfat) based [N1904-TF](https://centerblc.github.io/N1904/) dataset. The basic idea is to check if there are tags that can not be decoced.
