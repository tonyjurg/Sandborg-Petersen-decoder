# MACULA SP morph tag verification

Verification of the decode-ability of SP Morph tagging as found in the [MACULA XML source data](https://github.com/Clear-Bible/macula-greek/tree/main/Nestle1904/lowfat) on which we based our [N1904 Text-Fabric](https://centerblc.github.io/N1904/) dataset. The basic idea is to check if there are tags that can not be decoced.
